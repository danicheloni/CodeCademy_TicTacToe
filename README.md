I still need to add the function that does not allow the player to over-write a position already occupied

The player input could be a function of its onw, but then a don't know how to take turns switching automatically between them...

also how to change players:
use a vector

na função turns:
diz que player_atual = player[0]

ai abaixo do if endGames faz uma função changePlayer

e na função changePlayer
ve se player atual = player[0] e mudar pra player[1] se o contrário faz o contrário
